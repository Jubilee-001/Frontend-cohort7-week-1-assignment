Part 1: Environment Setup
Answer: I already have Visual Studio Code installed on my laptop and a working browser (Google Chrome) on my PC.

Part 2: Research and Reflection
i) What websites or web applications do you use regularly?
Answer: One website I use regularly is DeepL Translator, an online translation tool that I use to translate any language into English or another preferred language. The website interface is very user-friendly; anyone can simply paste the text they want to translate into the space provided, and within seconds, the result appears clearly in the selected language. I find it very efficient because it provides accurate translations and even suggests better sentence structures. Overall, DeepL makes communication across languages faster and more natural.

ii) What are you hoping to build by the end of this cohort?
Answer: By the end of this cohort, I hope to build a fashion website where users can explore and shop for different clothing designs and brands online. The goal is to allow people to browse easily through categories, view product details, and add their favourite items to a shopping cart. This way, the store owner can track interests and make it easy for users to complete purchases directly on the website.

iii) What aspects of frontend development are you most excited to learn about, and what aspects make you nervous?
Answer: I’m excited to learn every aspect of frontend development, especially HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I look forward to understanding how HTML structures a webpage and how CSS styles and designs it. However, JavaScript makes me a bit nervous because it controls the behaviour and interactivity of the site, but I’m eager to master it gradually.

Part 3: Exploration Exercise
Answer: While exploring three different websites using the browser’s developer tools, I spent over ten minutes on each and found the process very engaging. I noticed that most elements were wrapped inside <div> containers, and many sections used flex containers to arrange items neatly in rows and columns. In the footer sections, text links were grouped inside unordered lists (<ul>) and styled with grid layouts. I also observed a clear heading hierarchy, from <h1> to <h4>, which defines levels of importance on a webpage. This helped me understand how HTML and CSS work together to build organized and responsive designs.
